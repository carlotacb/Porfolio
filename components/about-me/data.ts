Since I left my last job, I've been traveling around the world to learn more about different cultures, improve my English, and find a way to grow my career by building projects on my own. In my university life, I've been part of the HackUPC organizing team with a lot of roles, the most important one was co-directing for two years, and now in my last year, helping the new team with leadership and finances.`;
