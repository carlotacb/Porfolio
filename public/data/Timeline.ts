After the pandemic, we faced the challenge of bringing back HackUPC at its best with the challenge of leading a team with a lack of motivation where everyone works as volunteers, without a salary. These two years we were able to do two editions. <br /><br /> <b>HackUPC 2022</b>: Co‑directed a team of 22 members, to organize Europe’s largest student hackathon, helping it regain momentum after the pandemic. Our maximum challenge was to motivate the team and lead them to create something amazing for our participants. <br /><br /><b>HackUPC 2023</b>: Co‑directed a team of 22 members, after being unable to find a successor, me and my co-director, we decided to run it again with the help of a 3rd member. Due to the lack of members with experience (since almost everyone from the previous team, left), I was also in charge of the logistics and finance team, to make the event grow back into a healthy, self‑sustaining organization. And after this edition, we can say we managed to create a healthy team, with the motivation and the knowledge to make HackUPC the greatest hackathon in Europe.",

In addition, we've rebuilt the company website with the new stack, Next.js, and Django. <br /><br /> After that, I joined the operations team, where we had the responsibility for the operational transactions, so the systems we built were only for the company members: mechanics, photographers... <br /><br /> This job has allowed me to work in different areas due to the creation of something from scratch, having roles like product owner, allowing me to understand the needs of the stakeholders to create the best features in the system, and full-stack developer building everything we plan.",
